## Требования к написанию баг-отчетов
https://academy.test.io/en/articles/2541949-bug-report-requirements 

## summary of our bug report requirements:

If you're reporting a functional bug, you must select one of the available Severities before filling the rest of the bug report. 

The Title must answer the questions of what happened, where the bug happened and when it is triggered, reflecting the real problem and avoiding describing what didn't happen (instead, focus on what actually happened).

The URL must be the link copied from your browser of the page where the bug is triggered.

The first Step to Reproduce must contain the URL of the landing page or the app name. The other steps should describe the actions you took to trigger the issue, with the last step being the last action taken to trigger the issue (and not "observe").

The Actual Result should be formed by one or more sentences explaining what happened after the last action. You can also add results of previous actions if they are necessary to understand the bug. It must not be the same as the title.

The Expected Result should contain information about what should have happened instead after you performed the last step to trigger the bug. It must not be a copy of the actual result with minor changes since those fields are designed for different purposes.

If an Attachment is required for your report, you must not forget to attach one.

Finally, you must select the correct Used Environment and browser (if applicable) used for testing, based on the device you were invited to test with when you accepted the cycle.**
